# Testing

## Automated Testing

### Python Testing

Going into this project I wanted to ensure I was following industry practices as best as possible, I knew about the importance of TDD (Test Driven Development) but has to research exactly how to do it for a project of this size and more often than not when put into practice I would find myself struggling to get tests to pass due to me actually making mistakes within my tests. To counter this I did a lot of reading, I would often use an LLM to bounce ideas off to help me brainstorm and decipher error codes and I included _A LOT_ of comments which were often simple things to help me keep track. Below is an example of my TDD on my blogs app:

![Test3](/media/README/TESTING/t2f.png)

![Test4](/media/README/TESTING/t2p.png)

This is just a small selection of the testing done, I actually wrote a total of 68 tests for all aspects of my site, below is the coverage achieved.

I was focused on testing the code I had written, so a large aspect of the code untested is from Django which has already been tested by the developers. I attempted the Webhooks but at this current moment in time I do not have the skill set or time to test those properly.
